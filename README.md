**Anonymous Message Board**
=============================

Project Anon Message Board

This is a project for freeCodeCamp. It is an anonymous message board where you can post a thread to any of the 
present boards. Each thread and reply must be given a delete password so that in the future you could delete them at anytime. This was made using nodejs/express, jQuery, mongodb, and basic html and css. I used chai and mocha for testing the api, and I used media queries in the css to make the webpage responsive.
